## Integration with Phase 1

```python
from sologit.engines import GitEngine, PatchEngine
from sologit.orchestration import AIOrchestrator

git_engine = GitEngine()
patch_engine = PatchEngine(git_engine)
orchestrator = AIOrchestrator()

# AI-driven workflow
repo_id = git_engine.init_from_zip('project.zip')
pad_id = git_engine.create_workpad(repo_id, 'feature')

# Plan with AI
plan_response = orchestrator.plan("add feature X")

# Generate code with AI
patch_response = orchestrator.generate_patch(plan_response.plan)

# Apply and merge
patch_engine.apply_patch(pad_id, patch_response.patch.diff)
git_engine.promote_workpad(pad_id)
```

---

## Phase 2 Requirements Verification

✅ **AI Integration layer** - Complete (85% coverage)  
✅ **Multi-AI orchestration** - Complete (89% coverage)  
✅ **Code generation** - Complete (84% coverage)  
✅ **Code review** - Complete (integrated in orchestrator)  
✅ **Git Engine integration** - Complete (no breaking changes)  
✅ **Error handling & testing** - Complete (67 tests, all passing)

2. **Patch Refinement**: Basic implementation, full iteration pending Phase 3
3. **Test Integration**: Test Orchestrator integration pending Phase 3

---

## Next: Phase 3

- Test orchestration integration
- Auto-merge on green tests
- Jenkins CI/CD integration
- Auto-rollback on failures
- Full deployment with real AI models
