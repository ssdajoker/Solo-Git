## Workpad Management System Enhancements

### New Features Added

#### 1. Workpad Switching (`switch_workpad`)
**Purpose**: Easily switch between workpads without manual Git commands.

```python
# Switch to a specific workpad
git_engine.switch_workpad(pad_id)

# Get currently active workpad
active = git_engine.get_active_workpad(repo_id)
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic branch checkout
- Updates last_activity timestamp
- Seamless context switching for developers

#### 2. Enhanced Workpad Listing (`list_workpads_filtered`)
**Purpose**: Advanced filtering and sorting of workpads.

```python
# Filter by status
active_pads = git_engine.list_workpads_filtered(status="active")

# Filter by test status
green_pads = git_engine.list_workpads_filtered(test_status="green")

# Sort by last activity
recent_pads = git_engine.list_workpads_filtered(
    sort_by="last_activity", 
    reverse=True
)

# Combine filters
pads = git_engine.list_workpads_filtered(
    repo_id=repo_id,
    status="active",
    sort_by="created_at"
)
```

**Supported Filters**:
- `repo_id`: Filter by repository
- `status`: active, promoted, deleted
- `test_status`: green, red
- `sort_by`: created_at, last_activity, title
- `reverse`: Sort order

#### 3. Workpad Comparison (`compare_workpads`)
**Purpose**: Compare changes between two workpads.

```python
comparison = git_engine.compare_workpads(pad_id_1, pad_id_2)

print(f"Files changed: {comparison['files_changed']}")
print(f"Details: {comparison['files_details']}")
print(f"Diff:\n{comparison['diff']}")
```

**Returns**:
- Metadata for both workpads
- Number of files changed
- Detailed file change information
- Complete unified diff

#### 4. Merge Preview (`get_workpad_merge_preview`)
**Purpose**: Preview what will happen when promoting a workpad.

```python
preview = git_engine.get_workpad_merge_preview(pad_id)

if preview['ready_to_promote']:
    print(f"✅ Safe to promote")
    print(f"Files changed: {preview['files_changed']}")
    print(f"Commits ahead: {preview['commits_ahead']}")
else:
    print(f"⚠️  Cannot promote: {preview['conflicts']}")
```

**Returns**:
- `can_fast_forward`: Whether fast-forward merge is possible
- `commits_ahead`/`commits_behind`: Divergence metrics
- `files_changed`: Number of files affected
- `files_details`: Detailed change information
- `conflicts`: List of conflicts (empty if none)
- `ready_to_promote`: Boolean recommendation

#### 5. Enhanced Cleanup (`cleanup_workpads`)
**Purpose**: Flexible workpad cleanup with multiple filters.

```python
# Cleanup old workpads from specific repo
deleted = git_engine.cleanup_workpads(
    repo_id=repo_id,
    days=7,
    status="active"
)

# Cleanup all stale workpads
deleted = git_engine.cleanup_workpads(days=14)
```

**Parameters**:
- `repo_id`: Limit to specific repository
- `days`: Age threshold (default: 7)
- `status`: Limit to specific status

#### 6. Active Workpad Detection
**Purpose**: Identify which workpad is currently checked out.

```python
active = git_engine.get_active_workpad(repo_id)

if active:
    print(f"Working in: {active.title}")
else:
    print("On trunk branch")
```

---

## Patch Engine Enhancements

### New Features Added

#### 1. Patch Statistics (`get_patch_stats`)
**Purpose**: Analyze patch complexity and scope.

```python
stats = patch_engine.get_patch_stats(patch)

print(f"Files affected: {stats['files_affected']}")
print(f"Additions: {stats['additions']}")
print(f"Deletions: {stats['deletions']}")
print(f"Complexity: {stats['complexity']}")
print(f"Files: {stats['files_list']}")
```

**Complexity Levels**:
- `trivial`: < 10 lines, 1 file
- `simple`: < 50 lines, ≤ 3 files
- `moderate`: < 200 lines, ≤ 10 files
- `complex`: < 500 lines, ≤ 20 files
- `very_complex`: ≥ 500 lines or > 20 files

#### 2. Patch Preview (`preview_patch`)
**Purpose**: Preview patch application without applying.

```python
preview = patch_engine.preview_patch(pad_id, patch)

if preview['can_apply']:
    print(f"✅ {preview['recommendation']}")
    print(f"Stats: {preview['stats']}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Conflicts: {preview['conflict_files']}")
```

**Returns**:
- `can_apply`: Whether patch can be applied cleanly
- `has_conflicts`: Conflict detection
- `conflict_files`: List of conflicting files
- `stats`: Full patch statistics
- `recommendation`: Application recommendation

**Recommendations**:
- `SAFE_TO_APPLY`: Low complexity, low risk
- `REVIEW_RECOMMENDED`: Moderate complexity
- `CAREFUL_REVIEW_REQUIRED`: High complexity
- `MANUAL_RESOLUTION_REQUIRED`: Has conflicts

#### 3. Detailed Conflict Detection (`detect_conflicts_detailed`)
**Purpose**: Enhanced conflict analysis with detailed information.

```python
result = patch_engine.detect_conflicts_detailed(pad_id, patch)

if result['has_conflicts']:
    for detail in result['conflict_details']:
        print(f"Conflict in {detail['file']}: {detail['reason']}")
```

**Returns**:
- `has_conflicts`: Boolean
- `conflicting_files`: List of file paths
- `conflict_details`: Detailed information per file
- `can_apply`: Application eligibility
- `error_message`: Error details if conflicts exist

#### 4. Patch Splitting (`split_patch_by_file`)
**Purpose**: Split multi-file patches into individual patches.

```python
split_patches = patch_engine.split_patch_by_file(multi_file_patch)

for file_path, patch in split_patches.items():
    print(f"Patch for {file_path}:")
    print(patch)
```

**Use Cases**:
- Selective patch application
- Review individual file changes
- Debugging patch issues

#### 5. Patch Combining (`combine_patches`)
**Purpose**: Merge multiple patches into one.

```python
combined = patch_engine.combine_patches([patch1, patch2, patch3])
```

**Use Cases**:
- Consolidating related changes
- Building composite patches
- Batch operations

#### 6. Syntax Validation (`validate_patch_syntax`)
**Purpose**: Validate patch format without applying to repository.

```python
validation = patch_engine.validate_patch_syntax(patch)

if validation['valid']:
    print("✅ Patch syntax is valid")
else:
    print(f"❌ Errors: {validation['errors']}")
    print(f"⚠️  Warnings: {validation['warnings']}")
```

**Checks**:
- Non-empty patch
- Presence of diff headers
- Presence of hunks
- Basic format validation

#### 7. Interactive Application (`apply_patch_interactive`)
**Purpose**: Apply patches with comprehensive validation and preview.

```python
# Dry run (preview only)
result = patch_engine.apply_patch_interactive(
    pad_id, 
    patch, 
    "Commit message",
    dry_run=True
)

# Actual application
result = patch_engine.apply_patch_interactive(
    pad_id, 
    patch, 
    "Commit message"
)

if result['applied']:
    print(f"✅ Applied: {result['checkpoint_id']}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Failed: {result['reason']}")
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. Syntax validation
2. Conflict detection
3. Preview generation
4. Application (if not dry run)

**Return Values**:
- `applied`: Success boolean
- `reason`: Failure reason (if applicable)
- `checkpoint_id`: Checkpoint created (if successful)
- `preview`: Full preview information
- `errors`: Error details (if any)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Advanced Workpad Workflow

```python
from sologit.engines.git_engine import GitEngine

git_engine = GitEngine()

# Initialize repo
repo_id = git_engine.init_from_zip(zip_buffer, "my-project")

# Create multiple workpads
pad1 = git_engine.create_workpad(repo_id, "Feature A")
pad2 = git_engine.create_workpad(repo_id, "Feature B")

# Switch to pad1 and work
git_engine.switch_workpad(pad1)
git_engine.apply_patch(pad1, patch1)

# Check merge readiness
preview = git_engine.get_workpad_merge_preview(pad1)
if preview['ready_to_promote']:
    git_engine.promote_workpad(pad1)

# List active workpads
active_pads = git_engine.list_workpads_filtered(
    repo_id=repo_id,
    status="active",
    sort_by="last_activity",
    reverse=True
)

# Cleanup old workpads
deleted = git_engine.cleanup_workpads(repo_id=repo_id, days=7)
```

### Example 2: Safe Patch Application

```python
from sologit.engines.git_engine import GitEngine
from sologit.engines.patch_engine import PatchEngine

git_engine = GitEngine()
patch_engine = PatchEngine(git_engine)

# Create workpad
pad_id = git_engine.create_workpad(repo_id, "New Feature")

# Validate patch syntax
validation = patch_engine.validate_patch_syntax(patch)
if not validation['valid']:
    print(f"Invalid patch: {validation['errors']}")
    exit(1)

# Preview patch
preview = patch_engine.preview_patch(pad_id, patch)
print(f"Complexity: {preview['stats']['complexity']}")
print(f"Recommendation: {preview['recommendation']}")

if not preview['can_apply']:
    print(f"Conflicts: {preview['conflict_files']}")
    exit(1)

# Apply interactively with dry run first
result = patch_engine.apply_patch_interactive(
    pad_id, patch, "Add feature", dry_run=True
)

if result['would_succeed']:
    # Actually apply
    result = patch_engine.apply_patch_interactive(
        pad_id, patch, "Add feature"
    )
    print(f"Applied: {result['checkpoint_id']}")
```

### Example 3: Patch Manipulation

```python
# Split multi-file patch
split_patches = patch_engine.split_patch_by_file(large_patch)

# Apply only specific files
for file_path in ['src/main.py', 'src/utils.py']:
    if file_path in split_patches:
        patch_engine.apply_patch(
            pad_id, 
            split_patches[file_path],
            f"Update {file_path}"
        )

# Get statistics
stats = patch_engine.get_patch_stats(large_patch)
print(f"Total changes: {stats['total_changes']} lines")
print(f"Files affected: {stats['files_list']}")
```
