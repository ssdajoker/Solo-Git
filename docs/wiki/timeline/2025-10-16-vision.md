## üéØ The Vision

Solo Git reimagines version control for the AI age. It's built on a simple premise: when you're working with AI assistants, **tests are more reliable than human review**.

## The Solo Developer's Dilemma

Traditional Git workflows are optimized for teams:
- **Branches** require naming, switching, and mental overhead
- **Pull Requests** assume human reviewers who are often the same person
- **Merge conflicts** disrupt flow and waste time
- **CI/CD** often runs too late to prevent broken trunk commits

For solo developers working with AI assistants, these patterns create friction without adding value.

## The Solo Git Solution

### 1. Ephemeral Workpads Replace Branches

Instead of `git checkout -b feature/login`, you simply say:
> "Add passwordless magic link login"

The system:
- Creates a disposable workpad (`pads/add-login-20251016-1423`)
- Copies trunk into an isolated sandbox
- Never requires you to name, switch, or manage it
- Auto-deletes after 7 days if unused

**Mental Model**: Workpads are scratch paper. Use them freely. They disappear when done.

### 2. Tests Are The Review

Traditional: Code ‚Üí Human Review ‚Üí Merge  
Solo Git: Code ‚Üí Test Suite ‚Üí Auto-Merge (if green)

### 3. The Pair Loop

**You speak natural language:**
```
"Add Redis caching to the search endpoint with 5-minute TTL"
```

**System responds with actions:**
1. **Plan** (2-4 seconds): Smart cloud model analyzes codebase
2. **Patch** (5-10 seconds): Specialized coder model generates changes
3. **Test** (15-30 seconds): Sandboxed test execution
4. **Merge** (1 second): If green, changes are in trunk

**Total time**: Under 1 minute for typical changes.

### 4. Intelligent Cloud Model Selection

All through Abacus.ai RouteLLM API:

- **Planning & Strategy**: GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.3 70B
- **Specialized Coding**: DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama, Llama 3.1 70B
- **Fast Operations**: Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, Mistral 7B

### 5. Safety Through Sandboxing

Every test runs in an isolated subprocess sandbox. Trunk is never touched by tests.

### 6. Jenkins as "Team Principal"

After auto-merge, Jenkins runs comprehensive smoke tests:
- If **green**: Celebrate, deploy if configured
- If **red**: Auto-rollback last commit, re-open workpad, alert user

## Philosophy

### What You Keep

- ‚úÖ Git's integrity, reproducibility, and time machine
- ‚úÖ Full audit trail of all changes
- ‚úÖ Ability to export to standard Git at any time

### What You Drop

- ‚ùå Manual branch management
- ‚ùå Pull request ceremony
- ‚ùå Blocking reviews by the same person
- ‚ùå Context switching between branches

### What You Gain

- ‚ú® Ephemeral workpads (disposable, auto-named)
- ‚ú® Test-gated auto-merge (green = instant trunk promotion)
- ‚ú® AI pair programming at every step
- ‚ú® Sub-minute cycle time for typical changes
