## Executive Summary

Solo Git is a paradigm shift in version control for the AI-augmented solo developer. It eliminates the friction of traditional Git workflows (branches, PRs, manual reviews) and replaces them with an intelligent, test-driven, auto-merging system.

### Core Innovation

**Tests are the review.** Traditional Git was designed for teams with human reviewers. Solo Git recognizes that in the human/AI pairing, comprehensive automated testing is more reliable than manual review processes.

### Key Components

1. **Ephemeral Workpads** - Replace traditional branches
2. **Test-Gated Auto-Merge** - Green tests = instant trunk promotion
3. **Multi-Model AI** - Smart routing between planning, coding, and fast models
4. **Pure Cloud Architecture** - Powered by Abacus.ai RouteLLM API

### Phased Timeline
