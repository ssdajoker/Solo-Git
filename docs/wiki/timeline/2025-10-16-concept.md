# Solo Git: Original Concept

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Format**: Attenborough-style narration

[attenborough, hushed delight]

Behold—the lone maker in its native range: one human, one tireless model, moving as a pair-creature. The herd's rituals—branch policies, review queues—are heavy antlers here. So we shed them.

What follows is **Solo Git**, a frictionless gait for the human/AI duet.

## The Essence (Tests Are The Review)

* **Single trunk.** No PRs by default.
* **Ephemeral workpads** instead of branches: disposable, auto-named sandboxes.
* **Tests = gate.** Green → merge to trunk immediately; red → keep changes quarantined in the pad.
* **Zip or git in.** Start from a `.zip` or a git url; the system initializes everything for you.
* **Pair loop.** You speak → AI plans & patches → sandbox runs → if green, it's already merged by the time you read the response.

## The Pair Loop (User Experience)

**You:** "Add passwordless magic link login."

**System:**

1. `ai.plan`: Design sketch, files to touch, test plan.
2. `pad.applyPatch`: Scaffold routes, adapters, test stubs.
3. `test.run`: Run fast tests.
   - **Green:** `pad.promote` happens before the AI finishes narrating the plan.
   - **Red:** AI proposes the smallest patch; loop until green.
4. **Jenkins** (team principal) triggers smoke tests in background; failures roll back automatically.

## What You Gain (And What You Drop)

* **Kept:** Git's integrity, reproducibility, and time machine.
* **Dropped:** Manual branching, PR ceremony, blocking reviews.
* **Replaced with:** Ephemeral pads + tests-as-truth + instant promote.
* **Added:** Resident AI strategist + fast executor model; tools for any agent to drive.

## A Final Whisper

Here the pair-creature runs: the human names intent; the AI sketches the hunt; a smaller companion snaps together sinew and bone; the sandbox tests the stride; and before the dust has settled, the track marshals wave the green flag on **trunk**.

No committees, no paperwork—only the rhythm of make, test, merge.
