# Solo Git Security Audit Report - 2025-10-22

This report summarizes the findings of a security audit conducted on the Solo Git codebase on October 22, 2025. The audit was performed using the `bandit` static analysis tool, version 1.8.6.

## Executive Summary

The `bandit` scan identified **17 potential security issues** within the `sologit` codebase. All of these issues are of **low or medium severity** and do not pose an immediate threat to the application's security. However, they do represent areas where the code could be improved to adhere to security best practices.

The findings fall into the following categories:

*   **Use of `random`:** 1 issue
*   **Use of `subprocess`:** 6 issues
*   **Hardcoded passwords:** 2 issues
*   **`try...except...pass`:** 5 issues
*   **Requests without timeout:** 1 issue

## Detailed Findings

### B311: Use of `random`

*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Confidence:** High
*   **Location:** `sologit/api/client.py:196`
*   **Description:** The `random.uniform` function is used to add jitter to the retry delay. While this is not a cryptographic use case, it's worth noting that the `random` module is not suitable for security-sensitive applications.
*   **Recommendation:** No immediate action is required, as this is not a security-critical part of the application. However, if the retry logic is ever used in a more sensitive context, it should be updated to use the `secrets` module instead.

### B404/B607/B603: Use of `subprocess`

*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Confidence:** High
*   **Locations:**
    *   `sologit/cli/main.py:11`
    *   `sologit/cli/main.py:273`
    *   `sologit/cli/main.py:296`
    *   `sologit/ui/test_runner.py:8`
    *   `sologit/workflows/auto_merge.py:5`
    *   `sologit/workflows/auto_merge.py:514`
*   **Description:** The `subprocess` module is used to run external commands, such as `npm` and `git`. While the current usage is safe, it's important to be aware that this module can be dangerous if used with untrusted input.
*   **Recommendation:** No immediate action is required, as all the commands are hardcoded and do not include user input. However, it's important to be vigilant about this in the future and to always sanitize any user input that is passed to `subprocess`.

### B105: Hardcoded passwords

*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Confidence:** Medium
*   **Locations:**
    *   `sologit/config/manager.py:582`
    *   `sologit/config/manager.py:584`
*   **Description:** The code contains what might be hardcoded empty strings for passwords.
*   **Recommendation:** This is a false positive. The code is simply initializing an empty string, not a password. No action is required.

### B110: `try...except...pass`

*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Confidence:** High
*   **Locations:**
    *   `sologit/engines/git_engine.py:830`
    *   `sologit/engines/test_orchestrator.py:530`
    *   `sologit/orchestration/planning_engine.py:276`
    *   `sologit/ui/autocomplete.py:141`
    *   `sologit/ui/autocomplete.py:155`
    *   `sologit/workflows/ci_orchestrator.py:172`
*   **Description:** The code uses `try...except...pass`, which can silence unexpected errors.
*   **Recommendation:** While this is not a security vulnerability, it is a code smell. It's recommended to replace the `pass` with a log message to ensure that any unexpected errors are not silenced.

### B113: Requests without timeout

*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Confidence:** Low
*   **Location:** `sologit/workflows/auto_merge.py:543`
*   **Description:** The code makes a `requests` call without a timeout. This could cause the application to hang indefinitely if the server is not responding.
*   **Recommendation:** This is a false positive. The `timeout` is being set dynamically using `getattr`. No action is required.

## Conclusion

The `bandit` scan did not identify any high-risk security vulnerabilities. However, it did highlight several areas where the code could be improved to adhere to security best practices. The recommendations in this report should be addressed to improve the overall security posture of the application.
