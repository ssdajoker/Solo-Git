# Phase 2 Heaven UI Refinement - Progress Report

> Comprehensive refinement of Heaven UI implementing "No UI" philosophy and Solo-Git integration

**Started**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 3/8 Complete - Critical Infrastructure Built  
**Next**: Component Simplification

---

## Overview

This document tracks progress on the comprehensive Heaven UI refinement task focusing on:
1. Visual harmony across all components
2. "No UI" philosophy implementation  
3. Solo-Git specific feature integration
4. Jenkins-like CI/CD visualization
5. Contextual UI patterns and polish

---

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### Phase 1: Research & Documentation (100% Complete)

#### Task 1: Solo-Git Architecture Research ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed  
**Duration**: ~15 minutes

**What Was Done:**
- Read Solo-Git README.md (comprehensive overview)
- Examined sologit/cli/main.py (CLI interface, commands)
- Reviewed sologit/core/ structure
- Studied sologit/orchestration/ai_orchestrator.py (multi-model routing)
- Analyzed sologit/workflows/auto_merge.py (auto-merge workflow)
- Explored sologit/workflows/ci_orchestrator.py (CI/CD features)

**Key Insights:**
- Solo-Git uses **ephemeral workpads** instead of branches
- **Multi-model AI**: GPT-4/Claude for planning, DeepSeek for coding, Llama for fast ops
- **Auto-merge workflow**: Test-driven promotion to trunk
- **CI orchestrator**: Jenkins-like smoke tests post-promotion
- **Heaven Interface**: 3 modes (CLI, TUI, GUI) - we're building the GUI
- **Cost tracking**: Built-in API usage monitoring

**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive understanding of Solo-Git unique features
- Clear mapping of how git workflow differs from standard git

---

#### Task 2: Feature Documentation ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed  
**File**: `/docs/SOLO_GIT_FEATURES.md`

**What Was Done:**
- Created 800+ line comprehensive feature mapping document
- Mapped every Solo-Git feature to UI requirements
- Defined new components needed (Toast, AICommitAssistant, WorkflowPanel, PipelineView, etc.)
- Outlined component modifications needed (CommitTimeline, StatusBar, CommandPalette, etc.)
- Created implementation priority matrix
- Defined success criteria

**Key Sections:**
1. Core Philosophy mapping (tests as review, trunk is king)
2. Workpads vs Branches (visual distinction requirements)
3. AI Orchestration (multi-model visualization)
4. Auto-Merge Workflow (pipeline stages)
5. CI/CD Integration (Jenkins-like features)
6. Test Orchestration (parallel execution, live output)
7. Heaven Interface Modes (CLI/TUI/GUI architecture)
8. UI Component Requirements (new + modifications)
9. Feature Implementation Priority

**Value:**
- Single source of truth for Solo-Git ‚Üí UI mapping
- Clear roadmap for all development work
- Prevents scope creep and missed requirements

---

### Phase 2: UI Audit (100% Complete)

#### Task 3: Component Audit ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed  
**File**: `/docs/UI_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

**What Was Done:**
- Audited all 6 core components for clutter
- Identified persistent vs contextual elements
- Documented opacity/visibility issues
- Found spacing/color inconsistencies
- Created harmonization checklist
- Prioritized implementation order

**Components Audited:**
1. **FileExplorer** - Persistent search bar, always-visible badges
2. **CommitTimeline** - Timeline too prominent, compare button persistent
3. **StatusBar** - Too many indicators, opaque background
4. **VoiceInput** - Good overall, microphone could fade when idle
5. **CodeEditor** - Persistent header, minimap not faded
6. **CommandPalette** - Excellent, minor enhancements possible

**Cross-Component Issues Found:**
- Spacing inconsistency (8px grid not enforced)
- Color variations (`/5` vs `/10` borders)
- Animation timing differences (150ms vs 200ms)
- Hover states not consistent

**Recommendations:**
- FileExplorer: Contextual search (Cmd+F), hover badges
- CommitTimeline: Fade timeline to 5%, contextual compare
- StatusBar: Remove most persistent indicators, 80% opacity
- CodeEditor: Contextual header, 30% opacity minimap
- All: Standardize spacing, colors, animations

---

### Phase 3: Critical Infrastructure (100% Complete)

#### Task 10: Toast Notification Component ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed  
**Files**: 
- `/src/components/web/Toast.tsx`
- `/src/components/web/ToastContainer.tsx`

**What Was Done:**
- Created Toast component with 4 types (success, error, warning, info)
- Auto-dismiss with progress bar
- Smooth fade in/out animations (150ms)
- Click to dismiss
- Optional action button
- Fully accessible (ARIA labels, role="alert")

**Features:**
- Type-based styling (color-coded borders and backgrounds)
- Progress bar showing time remaining
- Stacks vertically from top-right (configurable position)
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion
- Keyboard accessible (Esc to close)

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
<Toast
  type="success"
  title="Tests Passed"
  message="All 42 tests passed in 2.3s"
  duration={3000}
  action={{ label: "View Details", onClick: () => {} }}
/>
```

---

#### Task 11: Notification Manager ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed  
**Files**: 
- `/src/utils/notifications.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`

**What Was Done:**
- Created singleton NotificationManager class
- Queue system with priority levels (low, normal, high, critical)
- Deduplication (prevents same notification within 5s)
- Max 5 notifications at once (auto-prioritizes)
- Auto-dismiss based on priority
- Convenience methods (success, error, warning, info, progress)
- React hook integration (useNotifications)

**Priority-Based Durations:**
- Low: 2 seconds
- Normal: 3 seconds
- High: 5 seconds  
- Critical: Never auto-dismiss

**Usage:**
```typescript
// In any component
import { notifications } from '@/utils/notifications'

notifications.success("Saved", "File saved successfully")
notifications.error("Failed", "Could not save file", { priority: 'high' })
const progressId = notifications.progress("Running tests...", "0/42 tests")
```

**Deduplication:**
- Same notification won't show twice within 5 seconds
- Prevents spam from rapid-fire events
- Based on type + title hash

---

#### Task 20: Contextual Visibility Hook ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed  
**File**: `/src/hooks/useContextualVisibility.ts`

**What Was Done:**
- Created useContextualVisibility hook
- Implements "show on demand" pattern
- Auto-hide after configurable delay (default 5s)
- keepVisibleWhen condition support
- Event handlers (onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave, onFocus, onBlur)
- Specialized hooks (useHoverReveal, useKeyboardVisibility)

**Features:**
- Smooth show/hide with configurable delays
- Automatic cleanup on unmount
- Callback when visibility changes
- Easy attachment via handlers object

**Usage:**
```typescript
const { isVisible, show, hide, handlers } = useContextualVisibility({
  hideDelay: 5000,
  initiallyVisible: false,
  keepVisibleWhen: isEditing,
  onVisibilityChange: (visible) => console.log('Visibility:', visible)
})

return (
  <div {...handlers}>
    {isVisible && <DetailPanel />}
  </div>
)
```

---

## Blockers & Dependencies

### None Currently ‚úÖ

All required infrastructure is in place:
- Toast system ready for integration
- Hooks ready for component simplification
- Type system validated
- No external dependencies blocking progress

---

## Notes

### Design Philosophy
Following Jony Ive and Dieter Rams principles:
- "As little design as possible"
- UI should be invisible
- Information appears when needed, fades when not
- Every element must have clear purpose

### Technical Approach
- TypeScript-first (type safety)
- React hooks for state management
- Tailwind for styling consistency
- Accessible by default (ARIA, keyboard nav)
- Performance-conscious (lazy loading, memoization)

### Solo-Git Integration
- Workpads visually distinct from branches
- AI operations visible but not intrusive
- Test-driven workflow reflected in UI
- CI/CD pipeline clear and actionable
