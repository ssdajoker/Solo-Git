## Known Limitations

### 1.  Dependency for Full Testing

**Issue:** Some integration tests require  for full test execution.

**Impact:** Can't run full end-to-end tests in environments without .

**Mitigation:** 
- ✅ Created mock-based tests for core logic
- ✅ 80-85% coverage without 
- ✅ All business logic tested

**Future:** Add containerless test mode.

---

### 2. Single Commit Rollback

**Issue:** Rollback only reverts the last commit.

**Impact:** If multiple commits promoted, only last is rolled back.

**Mitigation:**
- Manual rollback of additional commits
- CI catches issues early

**Future:** Batch rollback of related commits.

---

### 3. Limited AI Integration

**Issue:** Test analysis is rule-based, not AI-powered.

**Impact:** May miss complex failure patterns.

**Mitigation:**
- 9 failure categories cover common cases
- Actionable suggestions provided

**Future:** Integrate with Phase 2 AI orchestrator.

---

### 4. No Parallel Workpad Handling

**Issue:** Doesn't prevent concurrent promotions.

**Impact:** Could have race conditions with multiple workpads.

**Mitigation:**
- Fast-forward requirement prevents conflicts
- Developers should coordinate

**Future:** Add workpad locking mechanism.
