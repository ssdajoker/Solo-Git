   - Per-model and per-task cost tracking
   - Persistent usage history with weekly stats

3. **Planning Engine** (114 statements, 79% coverage)
   - AI-driven implementation planning

4. **Code Generator** (138 statements, 84% coverage)
   - Unified diff patch generation
   - Support for create/modify/delete operations
   - Diff parsing and validation
   - Change statistics and metrics

5. **AI Orchestrator** (131 statements, 85% coverage)
   - Main coordination layer
   - Unified interface for planning, coding, and review

## Test Results

```
✅ 67 tests, all passing
✅ 86% average coverage across all AI components
✅ Zero test failures
✅ Complete integration with Phase 1
```

### Test Breakdown
- Model Router: 13 tests
- Cost Guard: 14 tests
- Planning Engine: 12 tests
- Code Generator: 14 tests
- AI Orchestrator: 16 tests

---

## Key Features

### Intelligent Model Selection
The system automatically routes tasks to the optimal AI model:

- **Simple tasks** → Fast models (Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B)
- **Standard coding** → Specialized coders (DeepSeek, CodeLlama)
- **Complex/Security-sensitive** → Top reasoning models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5)

### Budget Management
Complete cost control with:
- Daily spending caps
- Alert thresholds
- Per-model and per-task tracking
- Persistent usage history

### AI-Driven Workflow
Full support for the "Pair Loop":
1. User provides natural language prompt
2. AI generates implementation plan
3. AI generates code patches
4. AI reviews the changes
5. Integration with Git Engine for application

---

## Example Usage

```python
from sologit.orchestration import AIOrchestrator
from sologit.engines import GitEngine, PatchEngine

# Initialize components
git_engine = GitEngine()
patch_engine = PatchEngine(git_engine)
orchestrator = AIOrchestrator()

# Create repository and workpad
repo_id = git_engine.init_from_zip('project.zip')
pad_id = git_engine.create_workpad(repo_id, 'add-auth')

# AI plans the implementation
plan_response = orchestrator.plan("add JWT authentication")
print(f"Plan: {plan_response.plan.title}")
print(f"Model used: {plan_response.model_used}")
print(f"Cost: ${plan_response.cost_usd:.4f}")

# AI generates the code
patch_response = orchestrator.generate_patch(
    plan=plan_response.plan,
    file_contents=git_engine.get_file_contents(pad_id)
)
print(f"Patch: {patch_response.patch}")

# Apply the patch
patch_engine.apply_patch(pad_id, patch_response.patch.diff)

# Review before merging
review = orchestrator.review_patch(patch_response.patch)
if review.approved:
    git_engine.promote_workpad(pad_id)
    print("✅ Changes merged to trunk!")
```

## Integration with Existing Code

Phase 2 integrates seamlessly with Phase 1:

✅ **No breaking changes** to Git Engine  
✅ **Clean interfaces** between components  
✅ **Backward compatible** with existing workflows  
✅ **Enhanced** `SoloGitConfig` with `to_dict()` method  

---

## Configuration

Phase 2 components are configured through `~/.sologit/config.yaml`:

```yaml
abacus:
  endpoint: "https://api.abacus.ai/api/v0"
  api_key: "${ABACUS_API_KEY}"

models:
  planning_model: "gpt-4o"
  coding_model: "deepseek-coder-33b"
  fast_model: "llama-3.1-8b-instruct"

budget:
  daily_usd_cap: 10.0
  alert_threshold: 0.8
  track_by_model: true
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Mock AI Responses**: Uses mock responses when deployment credentials not provided
   - Allows development and testing without live API calls
   - Production setup will use real Abacus.ai deployments

2. **Patch Refinement**: Basic implementation
   - Full iterative refinement will be added in Phase 3

3. **Test Integration**: Test Orchestrator integration pending Phase 3
   - Auto-merge on green tests
   - Jenkins CI/CD pipeline

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. **Test Orchestrator Implementation**
   - Connect AI planning to test execution
   - Green/red test gates
   - Auto-promote on green

2. **Jenkins Integration**
   - CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Auto-rollback on failures
   - Smoke test execution

3. **Full Deployment**
   - Configure Abacus.ai deployment credentials
   - Enable real AI model calls
   - Production-ready setup

## Verification

To verify the implementation:

```bash
# Run all Phase 2 tests
cd /home/ubuntu/code_artifacts/solo-git
pytest tests/test_model_router.py \
       tests/test_cost_guard.py \
       tests/test_planning_engine.py \
       tests/test_code_generator.py \
       tests/test_ai_orchestrator.py \
       -v --cov=sologit/orchestration

# Expected: 67 passed in ~8s, 86% coverage
```
