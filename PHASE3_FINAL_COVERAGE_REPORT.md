### Test Orchestrator (Primary Improvement Target)

**Component**: `sologit/engines/test_orchestrator.py`  
**Baseline**: 40% (134 lines, 81 missed)  
**Final**: **100%** (134 lines, 0 missed)  
**Improvement**: +60 percentage points

#### Why This Component Had Low Coverage

The TestOrchestrator component had low initial coverage due to:
1. **Docker dependency**: Most methods require Docker, which isn't available in CI environments
2. **Async methods**: Complex async/await patterns that are harder to test
3. **Integration focus**: Originally designed for integration testing rather than unit testing
4. **Container orchestration**: Complex Docker container lifecycle management

#### Our Testing Strategy

To achieve 100% coverage without Docker, we implemented a comprehensive mocking strategy:

```python
# Mock Docker client and containers
@pytest.fixture
def mock_docker_client():
    """Create mock docker client."""
    client = Mock()
    container = Mock()
    container.wait.return_value = {'StatusCode': 0}
    container.logs.return_value = b"Test output"
    client.containers.create.return_value = container
    return client
```

#### Tests Added

**File**: `tests/test_test_orchestrator_comprehensive.py`  
**Count**: 24 comprehensive tests  
**Coverage**: 100% passing

## Test Quality and Patterns

### Mock-Based Testing

```python
def test_init_success(self, mock_git_engine):
    """Test successful initialization with Docker available."""
    with patch('docker.from_env') as mock_docker:
        mock_docker.return_value = Mock()
        
        orchestrator = TestOrchestrator(mock_git_engine, "python:3.11-slim")
        
        assert orchestrator.git_engine == mock_git_engine
        assert orchestrator.sandbox_image == "python:3.11-slim"
        assert orchestrator.docker_client is not None
```

### Async Testing

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_run_tests_parallel(self, mock_git_engine, mock_docker_client):
    """Test running tests in parallel."""
    with patch('docker.from_env') as mock_docker:
        mock_docker.return_value = mock_docker_client
        
        orchestrator = TestOrchestrator(mock_git_engine)
        
        tests = [
            TestConfig(name="test1", cmd="echo 'test1'", timeout=10),
            TestConfig(name="test2", cmd="echo 'test2'", timeout=10),
        ]
        
        results = await orchestrator.run_tests("pad_123", tests, parallel=True)
        
        assert len(results) == 2
        assert all(r.status == TestStatus.PASSED for r in results)
```

### Error Handling Testing

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_run_single_test_timeout(self, mock_git_engine, mock_docker_client):
    """Test test timeout handling."""
    container = Mock()
    container.start = Mock()
    container.stop = Mock()
    container.wait.side_effect = Exception("Timeout")
    container.remove = Mock()
    
    mock_docker_client.containers.create.return_value = container
    
    orchestrator = TestOrchestrator(mock_git_engine)
    
    test = TestConfig(name="test1", cmd="sleep 1000", timeout=1)
    result = await orchestrator._run_single_test(Path("/tmp/repo"), test)
    
    assert result.status == TestStatus.TIMEOUT
```

### Edge Case Testing

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_parallel_deadlock_detection(self, mock_git_engine, mock_docker_client):
    """Test deadlock detection in parallel execution."""
    orchestrator = TestOrchestrator(mock_git_engine)
    
    # Create circular dependency
    tests = [
        TestConfig(name="test1", cmd="echo 'test1'", depends_on=["test2"]),
        TestConfig(name="test2", cmd="echo 'test2'", depends_on=["test1"]),
    ]
    
    results = await orchestrator.run_tests("pad_123", tests, parallel=True)
    
    # Should detect deadlock and return empty results
    assert len(results) == 0
```

## Key Testing Insights

### 1. **Mocking Strategy for Docker**

The key to achieving 100% coverage without Docker was implementing a comprehensive mocking strategy:

- Mock Docker client initialization
- Mock container lifecycle (create, start, wait, logs, remove)
- Mock both success and failure scenarios
- Mock timeout conditions

### 2. **Async Testing Best Practices**

Testing async methods requires:

- Use of `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator
- Proper async fixtures
- AsyncMock for async methods
- Understanding of asyncio.wait and task management

### 3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**

To achieve 100% coverage, we tested:

- Edge cases (empty lists, circular dependencies)
- Boundary conditions (deadlock detection)
- Cleanup failures (container removal errors)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Docker Mocking is Essential**

For components that depend on Docker, comprehensive mocking is not optional—it's essential for CI/CD environments where Docker isn't available.

### 2. **Async Testing Requires Special Care**

Testing async methods requires understanding of:
- Event loops and task management
- AsyncMock vs. Mock
- Proper fixture design
- pytest-asyncio markers

### 3. **Edge Cases Matter**

Most bugs occur in edge cases:
- Empty inputs
- Circular dependencies
- Timeout conditions
- Cleanup failures
- Error propagation

### 4. **Test Organization is Key**

Well-organized tests are:
- Easier to maintain
- Easier to understand
- Easier to extend
- More valuable as documentation

### 5. **100% Coverage is Achievable**

With proper mocking, comprehensive test cases, and attention to detail, 100% coverage is not only achievable but maintainable.
