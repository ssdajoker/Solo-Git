## Missing Coverage (1%)

Only 5 statements remain uncovered across all modules:

### cost_guard.py (3 lines)
- Lines 122-123: Error logging in _save_history (exception path)
- Line 136: Edge case in day rollover

### planning_engine.py (2 lines)
- Lines 267-268: Regex extraction fallback (rare edge case)

These lines represent extremely rare edge cases that are difficult to trigger in testing but have proper error handling in place.
