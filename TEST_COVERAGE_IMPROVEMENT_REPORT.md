---

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Container Runtime Dependency (Historical)
**Issue:** The legacy test orchestrator expected a container runtime for isolation
**Impact:** Full coverage was impossible in environments where containers are banned
**Workaround:** Replace container hooks with subprocess mocks in tests

### 2. CLI Testing Complexity
**Issue:** CLI components require special testing infrastructure  
**Impact:** 0% coverage on all CLI modules  
**Solution:** Use Click's testing utilities and CliRunner

### 3. Test Data Structure Mismatches
**Issue:** Some test data structures had incorrect field names  
**Resolution:** Fixed by inspecting actual dataclass definitions
- TestResult uses `status` not `passed`
- TestConfig uses `cmd` not `command`
- FailurePattern uses `file` not `files`

‚úÖ **Auto-Merge Workflow:** 100% coverage (exceeded 90% target)  
‚úÖ **Core Components:** 100% coverage (maintained)  
‚úÖ **Orchestration:** 96% average coverage (exceeded 90% target)

The overall project coverage improved from 70% to 72%, with 27 additional statements covered and 17 new passing tests.

### Key Successes
1. Critical safety features (rollback) now fully tested
2. Primary workflow (auto-merge) comprehensively validated
3. Foundation laid for further coverage improvements
4. Test infrastructure enhanced for easier future testing

### Remaining Work
While significant progress was made, the following areas still require attention:
- CLI components (high priority)
- Logger utility (medium priority)
- Test orchestrator ( dependency issue)
- API client (depends on MCP server)

### Next Steps
1. Implement CLI testing using Click's CliRunner
2. Add logger utility tests
